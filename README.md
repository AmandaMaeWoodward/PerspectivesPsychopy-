This experiment will be used to determine if children's judgments after exclusion differ when exclusion is observed versus experienced. Children will both watch a game of Cyberball and experience exclusion via cyberball. After each game, children will answer questions about how nice the characters are, who they'd like to help, how much they'd like to play with each character, and whom they'd like to cooperate with. 

Counterbalancing factors are built into the game, and subject numbers are written so that the first character references the counterbalance (e.g. "A") and the second is the participant number (e.g. 003). 

At the moment, Counterbalance A should work, and other versions still need to be double checked.
